blurb: "What we say, over and over."

My girlfriend and I watched the purported "final" episode of *Bluey*, "The Sign", together soon after it came out. It was early in our relationship, and we picked up on Bingo's response of "we'll see" throughout the ups and downs of the episode, the seemingly-good things and the seemingly-bad.

We still say it a lot-- both hopefully and skeptically, 246 times via text as of 2/12/25-- and I wanted to practice embroidery (particularly my nemesis, the [french knot](https://rsnstitchbank.org/stitch/french-knot)), so I took a dotted piece of cotton fabric, embroidered a french knot on top of each dot, and then did a sort of [fly stitch](https://rsnstitchbank.org/stitch/fly-stitch) as a way to turn the knots into something resembling a network graph. The text is in [chain stitch](https://rsnstitchbank.org/stitch/chain-stitch). In the center, there are dots that aren't connected: a potential network, possibilities yet to be realized. We'll see.

I got a lot better at french knots in the process. This piece now lives on the dark purple wall above her bed.
