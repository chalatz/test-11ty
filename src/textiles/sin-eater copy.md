blurb: "The things one does to create corpora for scholars."
---

In mid-January 2025, I participated in the IMLS-funded *[Data Speculations](https://dataspeculations.org/): A National Forum on Library Digital Stewardship for Copyrighted Contemporary Culture*. A fair bit of time was spent upfront establishing [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) for the proceedings, so I can't credit the speaker, but at one point a presenter quipped, "I am the sin eater," with regard to their role in acquiring corpora for scholars to use, by working through some arguably legal gray-area corners of the internet, so the scholars themselves could keep their hands clean.

The following week was the inauguration, and I had enrolled in a week-long embroidery workshop in order to improve my embroidery skills before teaching *Data Visualization with Textiles* in the spring, and to stay far away from computers and the internet during what would certainly be a tumultuous time.

I did a few different projects during that time, but the one that became the major focus of my attention was a piece called "Sin Eater", which I wanted to give to one of the *Data Speculations* co-organizers, Sarah Potvin, the following week when I was giving a talk at Texas A&M.

This piece is a lot of [turkey stitch](https://rsnstitchbank.org/stitch/turkey-rug-knot-stitch-canvaswork) for the text, done on scraps from a woven cotton dress I'd made. I wanted the lettering to be *fuzzy*, because the law around this mode of text acquisition is kind of fuzzy, too. Between the colors and the letter-shapes it's not necessarily the most readable thing, but I can argue there's a reason for it (other than the fact that it was a learning piece): these activities are valuable, but time-consuming and absolutely not legible in either an academic or library context.

After I finished the lettering, I had a little time to spare before giving it to Sarah, so I added the logos for Sci-Hub and LibGen (both of which have proper logos and not just wordmarks, and I didn't want more letters on the piece). I embroidered those using backstitch, in colors that made them fade into the background (actually deliberately!), and they may be more visible from the back side.

As a final touch, I embroidered the phrase "dead elephant" (a tribute to the to-be-sunsetted [HathiTrust Research Center](https://www.hathitrust.org/about/research-center/)) in binary at the top. If I could do it again, I'd have done the spacing differently, but so it goes.

I was still embroidering binary the morning of my visit to Texas A&M, but was able to give it to Sarah in person before leaving!
