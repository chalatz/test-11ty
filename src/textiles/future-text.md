In fall 2023, Laura Wittman and Quinn Dombrowski taught DLCL 103, Future Text: AI in Literatures, Cultures, and Languages. They were not expecting a 60-student class, mostly CS juniors and seniors looking to fulfill their humanities requirement.

The class had a final project where students could choose a technical, creative, or analytical option. Quinn decided to do a final project too: weaving the data from the class.

The Future Text weaving captures four main kinds of data: assigned readings, lecture slides, attendance, and assignment grades. The weaving ends with course evaluation data, final grades, and email discussions from after the quarter was over.
