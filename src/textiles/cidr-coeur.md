This weaving documents and celebrates four months (August - November 2022) in the life of the Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR), a group within Stanford Librariesâ€™ Research Data Services (RDS) group.

CIDR had been through a lot around the time period that this weaving captures. In 2021, it was moved from the humanities group within the Libraries into the newly-formed RDS.

In August 2022, the new Associate University Librarian for RDS started, along with a new Academic Technology Specialist (ATS) in History.

The weaving captures the conversations over the following months, through November 2022, in the #cidr-coeur channel on Slack.
