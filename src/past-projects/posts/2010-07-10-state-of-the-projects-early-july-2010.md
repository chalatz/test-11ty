<h3>Birchbark letter XML</h3>
<p>I have at least a first pass at the names-in-context data for documents 1-23, to supplement the proof-of-concept data I put together previously.</p>
<h3>Medieval Slavic wiki</h3>
<p>I've put together a <a href="http://www.medievalslavic.org/Medieval_Slavic:Current_events">work plan</a> (subject to change) with the articles I'd like to try to incorporate into the wiki by October. After starting to go through the articles, it seemed reasonable to first work through the first chapters of Zaliznjak's 2004 <em>Древненовгородский диалект</em> to have a framework with some general overview content that I can then flesh out with details, arguments, points and counter-points from the articles. To this end, I've added pages on the <a href="http://www.medievalslavic.org/Old_Novgorod_dialect">Old Novgorod</a> and <a href="http://www.medievalslavic.org/Old_Pskov_dialect">Old Pskov</a> dialects, along with related pages as necessary.</p>
