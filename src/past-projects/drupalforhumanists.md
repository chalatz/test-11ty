*Drupal for Humanists* aimed to be a guide for how to use Drupal for digital humanities projects, and other web-based publication and communication needs in the humanities. It was written assuming little or no technical experience on the part of the reader, and none of the examples or tutorials require writing any code-- all configuration can be done using Drupal's user interface.
