This project began as a project with Prof. Elizabeth Honig, developing a Drupal-based interface for inputting data about Jan and Pieter Brueghel's paintings. It evolved into a [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/)-based static site with a custom Javascript image viewer/comparison tool and scale gallery visualization. I was responsible for the site architecture in both versions. See the [Brueghel Catalogue Raisonné](https://janbrueghel.net/).
