I was part of the Project Bamboo program staff for the majority of the project's duration, starting in 2008. During the Bamboo Planning Project, I was often a scribe at the workshops, and I later aggregated and wrote numerous summaries of the data contained in those notes. 

The materials here build upon the scribe notes taken at the Bamboo Planning Project workshops, held between April 2008 and June 2009. The notes from all of the workshops and wiki discussions have been organized by topic, and I've written summaries for some subsets of the data that were not covered in the Bamboo Scholarly Practice Report. They don't represent an official Project Bamboo effort, but one carried out independently over 200-some hours of nights and weekends. For more background on the work that was involved, please <a href="/dh/analysis/about-digital-humanities-analysis-project">see here</a>.
