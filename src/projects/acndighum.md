[Animal Crossing: New Digital Humanities](https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/acndh) is a DH talk series co-hosted with Liz Grumbach (Arizona State University) and Merve Tekg√ºrler, which brings together DH scholars from around the world in the virtual space of Animal Crossing, in order to discuss something new: a new article, a new project, a new book, or another new undertaking. 

Anyone who has the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing and a Nintendo Online membership can RSVP to the events and attend "in person" in the virtual space. For those who would prefer to watch the event streamed to their computer or device, we stream live [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/acndighum), and anyone with an internet connection can watch there and ask questions.
