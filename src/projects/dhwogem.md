[DH-WoGeM](http://www.dhwogem.org/) (Women and Gender Minorities in DH) organized a series of "conversations" around issues relevant to women and gender minorities in DH, starting in January 2019. After a poster presentation at DH 2019 that won the outside-the-box poster award (thanks to Dr. Cheese Bones the skeleton co-presenter) and a roundtable at ACH 2019, we submitted the SIG proposal to ADHO, which approved it in April 2020.

The pandemic has put our nascent plans on hold, due to ongoing care responsibilities, but hopefully the group can resume in 2022.
