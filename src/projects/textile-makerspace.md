When I started my current job at Stanford, the department manager showed me to my office, then, to my surprise, took me upstairs to my computer lab. After asking around and learning that no one was using the computer lab for anything, I cleaned up the computers and AV equipment in various states of decay, bought a couple sewing machines out-of-pocket, and started the [Textile Makerspace](https://textilemakerspace.sites.stanford.edu/).

Soon I was joined by co-director Nichole Nomura, and  we managed to get more equipment thanks to donations (including a Cricut thanks to Prof. Elaine Treharne's *Text Technologies*). We had a pretty reliable turnout whenever we were open, including undergrads who helped keep the space open for more hours, when March 2020 rolled around. We're now working on rebuilding.
