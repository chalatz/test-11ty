blurb: "A group for sharing resources & collaboration around DH in languages besides English."
---

Started after a DH 2019 pre-conference workshop on DH for non-Latin scripts, the [Multilingual DH group](https://multilingualdh.org/) has applied for ADHO SIG status. In the meantime, the group organizes periodic meet-ups to discuss developments and collaboration opportunities for DH in non-English languages, and occasionally updates [lists of resources](https://github.com/multilingual-dh) for doing DH in many languages, along with a [multilingual DH bibliography](https://github.com/multilingual-dh/multilingual-dh-bibliography).
