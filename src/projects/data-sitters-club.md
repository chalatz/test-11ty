The [*Data-Sitters Club*](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/books) is a collaboration with Lee Skallerup Bessette, Katia Bowers, Maria Sachiko Cecire, Anouk Lang, Roopika Risam, Mark Algee-Hewitt, and a rotating cast of [guest data-sitters](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/chapter-2.html). We explore various DH methods, mostly related to computational text analysis, using a corpus of Ann M. Martin's classic 80's and 90's girls series "The Baby-Sitters Club". We share the code, our feelings, and our frustrations in a series of Jupyter Notebook-based "books", and our "Multilingual Mystery" sub-series tackles Multilingual DH issues using translations of the BSC. It's part pedagogy, part nostalgia, and a lot of fun!
