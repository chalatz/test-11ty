I don't see that. We're assuming we know what we're doing, why this matters I don't have a concrete narrative, but it's beyond that. I don't have anything I can tell the administration about how they'll get more bang for their buck, why not just put the money in financial aid? We need to crystallize this. It's sorta in scholarly narratives, but that's just raw material for this - it's not this."

What's the sell for my institution to pay to play when several of us are happy to play and contribute whatever we can find. Chance to lead and shape?

That's a lot of investment - how do we capture that? Dollar amount question is one we need to wrestle with. How do we do that without pushing people out the door, but also doesn't turn into an incentive for creating an administrative monster that consumes all the available resources that don't end up generating much stuff. Like any project, PB needs to give value back in some way. Could show up more in research administration area. There's value in being associated with it - formal contribution to formal relationship."
