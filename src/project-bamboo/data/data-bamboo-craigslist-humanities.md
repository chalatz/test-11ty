<p>"I wonder about the phrase  "marketplace of services".   At first blush, it worked for me.  But considering our broad audience, would the associations of the metaphor be attractive to everyone?  Also, the term "marketplace" suggests -- to me at least -- kinds of transactions that are not inclusive of all that we're talking about here.  I don't have great suggestions for another term, but staying close to the marketplace idea, I wonder about a "Bamboo services exchange," "community exchange", "exchange mechanism", etc.  This seems to allow for the concept of a "bid" without marginalizing the exchange of gifts.  Just a thought."

<p>"Bamboo Marketplace - I have faculty asking "I just have a little small project, some Java code, something that will do this) - we don't have a Java programmer for your specific project, but what if there was a marketplace and look for people who might be selling their wares there. Java programmers with some background in the Humanities - like bringing something home from the marketplace and taking it home. Helps me - solved problem for faculty member."

<p>"Human motivation: a taxonomy of motivation?<br />
-Goodwill: nope, we hope community will continue at that, Exchange isn't targeted there<br />
-Threats: not very fun or effective<br />
-Bribery, honor, joy<br />
-Bribery<br />
--RFP bidding system (useful for defined needs)<br />
--Classified ads ("Craiglist for scholars") - helps bridge key support staff during economic turmoil; "seeking... available..."<br />
--Incentives and awards; community-generated pool/distribution method; encourage and reward participation<br />
--Mechanisms for promotion & tenure: who's using my stuff, and how?<br />
--People have to do some extra work to get their work compatible w/ Services <span class="glossary-term" title="The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

<p>"Our institutions have certain limitations in what they can give to projects (free staff, funding, etc). Maybe the Exchange could be something like a commercial marketplace - some institution has a project, don't want to put 8 months of resources into it, willing ot pay someone else to develop it for them. Human resource center. Some conflict about how far that could go for an institution. Institutions providing resources? Do we pay? Do we need a new place that provides this kind of connection? Could we use existing sites (DiRT)? Some confusion re: what the Exchange is all about. Interested in idea that we could develop Seasr and Zotero and Sakai; all of us could send an e-mail to the program staff, listing free websites that provide services to faculty in this area. Program staff could list/aggregate them, so people know broad scope of A&H scholarship was currently."

<p>"We're a small place, hired one local programmer from San Francisco who wanted to get away to Virginia, did a mockup and developed it in about 3 weeks. Added stuff as much as he was available; started out with Exchange focus, but due to Drupal, had to add in all the other stuff, so you get blogs and wikis and groups. Cost $4k to pay him to do it, worth doing to explain to our faculty what we're talking about when we talk about Bamboo; had to show them something. Welcome any questions or comments, basically did it because we wanted to do something."
