<p>"They tend to favor institute of advanced study model there [in Europe] (think tank, shelter of scholarly activity, folks from different disciplines, but discipline question isn't in play, or connected w/ universities, or contexts, or involving questions about disciplines. Not necessarily embedded in universities, but alongside." (<span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

<p>"We get closer to N America form [of humanities centers] if we think about interdisciplinarity- this has been shibboleth under which these centers have been developed. Counting how often provosts/presidents use the word interdisciplinary - astonishing how many times they can use it in 3 minute greeting. This gets closer, but not the key issue for humanities centers. A way of thinking about disciplinarity posits disciplines as static and stable and imagines all interesting work appears between them - doesn't do justice to either end."

<p>"Hum center form can be understood as more generic center of a whole series of other kinds of centers that hve been developed in last 40 years around "studies" (gender, race, science, etc). Clearinghouse for all those specific "studies" - shadow disciplines trying to emerge. "Emergingly disciplinary". That evolution, can be helpful to think of CenterNet project - evolution from parts of universities that are IT places that have increasingly addressed disciplinary fields. Humanities center form evolving toward a notion of institutional change - taking more responsibility for, not to defer change by virtue of their existence, but new ways of putting university together. Movement on d hum side represented by digital humanities center -supplying most important/powerful engines of change. Not engine of change that led to Hum institute for in 50's/60's (new theoretical formations, new topics)."

<p>"John Unsworth cited strengths of DHum centers bringing to field - mentoring for H scholars doing digital research, staffing and long-term security for projects, opportunities for H faculty/grad students working as collective intellectual enterprise. D Hum centers could play fundamental role in transforming humanities if they worked together. Most important outcome: founding of CenterNet - over 200 members.

<p>""a survey of Digital Hum centers in the US" - sobering assessment of current landscape. 1. silo-like nature of centers is creating untethered digital production, projects with little support outside center, more likely to be orphaned. 2. doesn't leverage resources community-wide. 3. large-scale coordinated efforts to build cyberinfrastructure are missing."

Serviced all hum scholars across the university, not just those in hum research center. Collaborate w/ multimedia researchers, integrate digital media.

<p>"In the last 3 years, also realized that like a lot of us in Humanities, about critical input of digital media into humanities - can't just stay as niche research platform. Began to pervade a lot of research being done across the board in the centers. Since 2006, has been development - evolution of humanities research. Had a lot of discussion to create what we call a digital humanities hub. Just got some funding in the middle of last year. Contains all constituents who supported initial stage of formation of digital humanities hub - range of activities is a lot wider, caters to a wider constituency."

<p>"Australian gov has set up national collaborative research structure strategy, but until 2007 it catered only to science sector. Millions of dollars of funding, but didn't think Hum needed research infrastructure in this area. Only early last year they said they'd include Hum and SS in assessment of the sector's capability. Giving them 50 mil dollars if they can justify that they need those resources. Our center has been critically involved - <span class="glossary-term" title="Chad J.

<p>"In listening to [scholars], attempting to respond, might be worthwhile to put pressure here on the notion of research and project. Research: would prefer to re-describe or re-name what we are attempting to designate "research" either as scholarly practices or simply in terms of work activity. In content of Hum centers, this does tend to be interdisciplinary, breadth that reaches from arts through trad hum disciplines, to social sciences, but isn't particularly adherent to (has mandate not to) work with specific disciplinary divisions, but work across and between them 9and across media)."

<p>"Would be missing something important if we went forward thinking about DHum in any context w/o taking account of amount of work/activity that goes in form of "exchange of ideas".

<p>"Not pursuing a "ghetto" for dig humanities, but blend seamlessly in activities of the center. Enhancing and supporting the activities we carry on regularly. Recognize that there's out there in the world some skepticism and resistance to some of these new directions. Were told at one meeting "why are you doing this, we want to spend less time in front of our computers". Clearly Hum centers can take a lead (some of these activities can be blended as seamlessly as possible into ongoing scholarly practices - a greater chance of success). Both in what we've received/learned and what we're putting out - one needs to be careful in managing expectations (hopes, promises)."
