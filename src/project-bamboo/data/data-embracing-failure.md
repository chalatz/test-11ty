<p>"How would I put someone in touch with these tools? At the moment, they're not well-documented, which is the purpose of surveys. Happens in the context of a project, and then disappears.

<p>"End-of-grant reports deemphasize "what went wrong" -- it might be better if one were rewarded for frankness in this area of self-evaluation.

That would enforce some accountability, and enrich proposals by allowing them to learn what didn't work ... nothing to be ashamed of ... digital disaster. If you come to a dead end it'll help others to not go in an unproductive direction. Accounting is a really rich term for describing this process:  being accountable and responsible for the results of work. Peer-review is a way of discovering flaws.  Critique.  Public response.
