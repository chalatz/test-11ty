<p>"Not only content side, but also intellectual payoff for humanists - intellectual excitement (how do I pitch this to my English colleagues) has to be there. Sciences embrace this technology, work collaboratively; Humanists still tend to be alone individuals. Production still seems to be "individual genius", originality. Technologies are the methodologies for IT folks; humanists don't quite see that- still working under book mode."

<p>"How do we use [tools and repository partners] to advance research? Adopt some of the methods from genetics/biology. Humanities may not be able to adopt this: Humanities believe they can exist without technology, sciences are engaged with technology throughout the process of becoming part of the discipline. Where is the value for the faculty? How can we evolve with the system? Scholars have not identified what they are using technology for."

<p>"Members of the analysis group resonated with the professor's comments about creating fora in which faculty members could discuss assignments and have discussions with students about their own experiences completing assignments using visual materials. The group also discussed the importance of providing workshops that are tailored to assignments rather than tools. With regard to this case in particular, the College should provide workshops on creating effective presentations rather than on working with PowerPoint or other presentation tools. Such workshops would be of particular value to students."
