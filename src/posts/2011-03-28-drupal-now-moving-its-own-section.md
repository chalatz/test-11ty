<p>I've come to the realization that Drupal site breakdowns, tutorials, pedagogical materials, and musings are evolving into their own project, and will consume the blog if I don't move them elsewhere. So, I've created <a href="/drupal">a new section of this site</a> to publish and organize things related to using Drupal for higher education. There's a <a href="http://www.quinndombrowski.com/drupal/feed">separate RSS feed</a> for it as well.</p>
<p>To start with, I have the previously-blogged site breakdown for the <a href="/drupal/site-breakdowns/building-virtual-research-environment-vre-drupal-under-5-hours">virtual research environment I created in 5 hours</a>, and a <a href="/drupal/site-breakdowns/wordpress-drupal-or-how-i-made-site">breakdown for this very site</a>, alongside <a href="/drupal/tutorials/drupal-jargon-explained">Drupal jargon explained!</a> and my notes from Do It With Drupal a few years ago. </p>
<p>I've also posted my weekend manifesto, <a href="/drupal/musings/if-institution-could-support-just-one-tool-teaching-and-research-it-should-be-drupal">If an institution could support just one tool for teaching and research, it should be Drupal</a>. Cue the firestorm.</p>
