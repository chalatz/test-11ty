<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinnanya/5286980202/" title="Trotsky salad, ready to be served by quinn.anya, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5286980202_632a1a1849_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Trotsky salad, ready to be served" class="alignright" /></a>I recently decided to make beet salad, but managed to forget to pick up every single ingredient in the recipe, save sliced beets. What I did have on hand was a lot of produce that had previously been bought and forgotten. I threw it all together, in a combination that sounds dodgy at best, and called it "Trotsky Salad" (Russian beets meet Mexican avocado-- and a little nuts!). The result was incredibly delicious-- if you're not opposed to beets-- and we've been eating it ever since. It's vegan, and pretty healthy (save perhaps the sodium in the canned beets.)</p>
<p>All quantities listed below are flexible; I doubt I've made it with the exact same proportion of ingredients twice. The quantity below serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a side. From start to finish, it probably takes 15 minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 cans sliced beets (or 1 lb sliced beets from the deli)</li>
<li>2 avocados</li>
<li>2 bundles of green onions</li>
<li>2 Roma tomatoes (or 1 container grape tomatoes)</li>
<li>1/2 cup roasted peanuts, lightly salted, pulverized in a food processor</li>
<li>~ 1 Tbsp lemon juice; add a bit more if you plan on keeping it overnight, to minimize the avocados' turning brown</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Harissa*, or more to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>Coarsely chop up and mix together. the sliced beets, avocados, green onions, and tomatoes. Mix in the lemon juice and harissa. Serve, covering each portion with pulverized peanuts.</p>
<p><em>* Hot sauce isn't a good substitute for harissa. Unlike most hot sauce, it has no vinegar. The brand I use, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinnanya/5286377041/">Le Cabanon</a> (</em></p>
<h3>Variant: Trotsky Does Thailand</h3>
<p>This may simply be substituting one obscure ingredient for another, but if you find your local grocery store is out of harissa, but you have a small can of Thai panang curry paste lying around (actual Thai curry paste, not the "Thai" curry paste made by and for Americans), you can substitute 1/3 to 1/2 can of the curry paste for the harissa. I can vouch for getting a positive result out of panang curry paste, but I can imagine masaman curry also being good.</p>
